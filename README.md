# IDC-621: MCS

This repository contains coursework and project implementations for IDC-621.

## Modules

- CA Module: This module implements a continuous two-dimensional cellular automata-inspired model in which multiple particle species interact through short-range pairwise forces. Each species is governed by an interaction matrix that determines attractive or repulsive behaviour within a finite radius. The system evolves in discrete time steps with velocity damping and reflective boundary conditions, leading to emergent clustering, segregation, and self-organised structures arising purely from local interaction rules.
